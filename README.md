## ALL-IDB Classifiers

The ALL-IDB Classifers repository hosts a collection of research using Fabio Scottie's ALL-IDB (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing) dataset. The repository provides tutorials and codes for creating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) & Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) created with various languages and frameworks.

# ALL Papers Evaluation

This project evaluates a number of different research papers on detecting Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia using Convolutional Neurals Networks and the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Image Database for Image Processing dataset. 

The purpose of the project is to recreate the networks proposed in the papers, and compare results between the different types of networks. Papers used in this evaluation are as follows:

-  **PAPER 1:** [Acute Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System](https://airccj.org/CSCP/vol7/csit77505.pdf "Acute Leukemia Classification Using Convolution Neural Network In Clinical Decision Support System") by Thanh.TTP, Giao N. Pham, Jin-Hyeok Park, Kwang-Seok Moon, Suk-Hwan Lee, and Ki-Ryong Kwon
- **PAPER 2:** [Leukemia Blood Cell Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network](http://www.ijcte.org/vol10/1198-H0012.pdf "Leukemia Blood Cell Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network") by T. T. P. Thanh, Caleb Vununu, Sukhrob Atoev, Suk-Hwan Lee, and Ki-Ryong Kwon.
